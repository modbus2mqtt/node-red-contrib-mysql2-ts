## Usage

This node is really simple.

Put your query in the `topic` variable and, if you have arguments, put them in an object in the `payload` variable.
You will get the result in the `payload` output variable.

Example:

```javascript
msg.topic = 'SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `name` = :name AND `age` > :age;';
msg.payload = { name: 'Adrien', age: 30 };
return msg;
```
If you have multiple arguments, put them in an array of objects in the `payload` variable.
You will get the result in the `payload` output variable.

Example:

```javascript
msg.topic = 'INSERT INTO `users` (`name`,  `age`) VALUES( :name, :age) ;';
msg.payload = [
  { name: 'Adrien', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Maria', age: 62 }
]
return msg;
```
> Avoid SQL injections!!
>
> Do not NEVER EVER put variables content in `topic` directly!
> Always use the `payload` variable to pass your arguments.


## Troubleshooting


### Error "Connections using insecure transport are prohibited while --require_secure_transport=ON"

You have to connect using TLS encryption. Simply check the box in this node configuration.


### Error "ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client"

You are probably using another node than `node-red-contrib-stackhero-mysql` and tryin to connect to a MySQL >= 8 server using "Caching SHA2 password" authentication method.

To resolve that issue, simply use this node `node-red-contrib-stackhero-mysql`.
